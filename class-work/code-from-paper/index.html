            <h3>directions</h3>
            <br>
            <li>your pot should be pre-seasoned with attraction</li>
            <li>add a lot of tenderness. perhaps more than you use with usual recipes, as this one is special. if you need it to be more tender, feel free to butterfly it.</li>
            <li>add about 3 cups of understanding. this is one of the most important ingredients. once you've added understanding bring the heat down to medium low and let simmer for 5 hours.</li>
            <li>add sweetness to taste. also feel free to improvise how much sweetness depending on who you're making it for. some like only a dash, whereas others may like a lot more.</li>
            <li>some of the best love comes from friendships. however, it's not necessary for this recipe. only use friendhsip if you feel so inclined to or it comes naturally to you.</li>
