            An act of the mind. To move, to make happen,
            to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state
            of real <em>existence</em> rather than possibility.

            And poets love <em>possibility!</em>
            They love to wonder and explore. 
            Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of <em>possibility</em>, has to exist!

            As the poet Ralph angel puts it,
            “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.”
            the weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives;
            an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater;
            theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle;
            in other words, self-consciousness is <em>theatre</em>.

        <p>
            To conduct oneself, to behave. 
            How a poem acts marks its <em>individual</em> character. 
            A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure.
            To pretend, feign, impersonate.

    <div id="mindsub">
        <p>
            That, too, yes and always, 
            because self-consciousness is its own pretension, 
            and has been from its beginning; the human <em>mind</em> 
            is capable of a great elastic theatre.

            Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their 
            poems <em><u>begin</u></em>, the answer is always the same: a phrase, 
            a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something 
            seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined.

    <div id="lessonsub">
        <p>
            And the <em>lesson</em> is always the same, and young poets recognize this 
            to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any 
            idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a
             dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. This is a 
            </em>lesson</em> that can only be learned by trial and error.

            And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully 
            written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the page, 
            in India ink, <em><u>beautifully</u></em> apart from the rest of the text, were the words The End.
