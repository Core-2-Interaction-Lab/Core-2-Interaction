                At the end when she touched upon the ‘email me’ button and how that was what she missed most about amateur sites it was most in tune with what I feel the internet was about in the first place — connection. It was made to connect people, and the email me button can be a foil to speak towards the advancement of websites and social media as a whole. There are numerous studies done on how although the internet and technology have been developed and can be utilized to connect with others, we feel more isolated than ever. As the web has developed, personal aspects such as the email me button or the welcome page have depleted.

                I completely agree with the author on what she wrote about what websites should be created for — connecting with each other and making something new/interesting. When she wrote that when a website is just a collection of your already existing work, it’s dead once you hit publish, I felt totally called out and motivated to make a website for my own work that's interesting and adds something new.

                I think you can consider web trends similar to fashion in that we redo old aesthetics about every 20 years. Now we see the early web page coming back into style. I think you could look at the reading and use it to predict upcoming web trends as well, especially with how interfaces looked and pixelated typefaces/art.

                I thought some of the text in this reading came off as a bit limiting, especially the first page of the book being a do’s and don'ts list. It was a little ironic, seeing as how the book was referencing other art books and a commonly discussed topic within art is how there ‘are no rules’. Some of them were very basic as well, I don’t think there’s any good reason why a book can’t be a square. Given that however, I liked the book about architecture and how you could flip part of the page to create composite images.

                I also found this reading quite dense, and I wished there were more concrete details to support the author's claims. I found the part about silicon valley interesting but not surprising — yet again a huge part of America’s infrastructure is controlled and dominated by white men. Although I do wonder if the tides are slowly shifting and if they are, in what ways? I wish there were more details on how this domination of technology has specifically impacted the GUI. What comes to mind is how phone cameras have issues truly capturing darker skin tones, a feature the google pixel now advertises.

                I think it’s cool to see how many things that were started in the 80s-2000s started up. It was only an excel sheet when it started. What really interested me was when they explained why they chose the name cyberfeminism, almost as an oxymoron to poke fun at the unfeminist terms popular at the time like fembot and cyberbabes. I’ve never even thought of it before, but it seems that a common sci-fi trope is the breakdown of feminism and the regression of women's rights. We see this in Barbarella, the fifth element, etc.

                I really liked this reading. It was humorous but somewhat serious the way they were likening web surfing to spiritual activity. I like the idea of viewing the internet as something more significant that you contribute a small part to, especially because this sentiment towards the internet has shifted to focus on individuals since.  Perhaps earlier the internet felt less lonely than it does now.
