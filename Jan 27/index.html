1. Describe your previous experiences with coding.
    I've taken one class last semester with coding, and honestly even though I put a lot of effort into learning it I feel I'm still way behind my peers because of how I was taught. But I'm motivated to get better and I think I'm a quick learner.
a. What classes have you already taken where you were exposed to HTML/CSS/JS?
    Just the one class last semester, Interaction 1.
b. What parts of the class resonated with you?
    We did a 'still life' drawing using CSS and I realised how similar to illustrator it is. Definitely the style aspects I'm really excited about because when I was younger I made wix sites for fun. Learning how to do that properly will be a great skill.
c. What parts were most confusing?
    Definitely the JS. I feel I'm basically a complete beginner at that and am starting from a blank slate.

2. How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in this class to help reduce this anxiety?
    I'm super excited to learn code. I definitely want to brush up and expand on my skills. I think it could be a great tool and something I might be really passionate about in the future. My only anxiety relating to coding would be being behind my peers because of how my class was last semester. I think I'll catch up fine on my own but lots of specific feedback is something I always appreciate.

3. How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?
    I think it depends how far I go with learning it. I do think I could be good at it, but if it doesn't work out I'd probably just fall back onto more traditional design. But I could totally see myself doing web design in the future as well. It's quite up in the air for me because I don't think I really had a chance to properly learn how to code last semester.

4. What text editor do you prefer to use?
    I'm not sure which I prefer to use, because I've only used brackets. I wouldn't mind using an editor that has a learning curve if it was more intuitive/advanced later on.

5. Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub.
    I have, but I was confused by it. My understanding is it's a Google Drive for code. You have different repositories (folders) which are linked to folders in your computer. When you edit your pages you can push your code (commit to main?) and it will update on GitHub.

6. Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this relationship. “Bonus points” for creative analogies.
    I would use the house analogy because it's how I've always seen code but you already brought it up in class. Perhaps you can see coding as putting on a play. The stage, actors, all the physical aspects are the HTML. They're the foundation of the play/the page. The costumes, set decorations, lighting is the CSS -- mainly for aesthetics. The blocking (where the actors move), changing of set pieces, etc. would be the JS. It makes the play much more engaging.

7. Using each HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance (remember, there’s 6 levels of heading tags).
    I'm going to do my favorite desserts instead.
            <h1>Brownies</h1>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <h3>Creme Brulee</h3>
            <h4>Cheesecake</h4>
            <h5>Ice cream</h5>
            <h6>Cupcakes/cake (red velvet especially)</h6>

8. Create an unordered list ( <ul> ) and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related websites. Include a paragraph ( <p> ) on each site describing why it is important to you.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>
                        <p>Pinterest is a site where you can collect inspiration, it's my most used tool for creating mood boards, which is an important aspect of my process.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KelLauren">Kel Lauren</a>
                        <p>This is Kel Lauren's YouTube channel. They're a freelance graphic designer based in Portland. I love their work, and their content was my first introduction to proper graphic design. They also have a website called GrandpaGrandpa where they compile and make helpful free rersources for other designers.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVUVUoXrPzM">Aaron Draplin</a>
                        <p>Not a website, but this video was incredibly helpful when I first started learning how to design. I still come back to it. Aaron Draplin is a legend.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

9. Insert an image that brings you joy to the page. Make sure the image includes alt text that describes the image.
<img src="dad-cinnamon.png" width=200px height=auto 
                alt="my dad holding up my dog Cinnamon to say hi to me on FaceTime">


10. Insert a video embed into the page (for example, a YouTube or Vimeo embed tag of a video of your choosing).
<iframe 
                width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOBwqTFWmHA" title="Her's" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>

11. Nest the following series of HTML tags inside each other, where each → represents a new level. Make sure to maintain proper indentation.
                1. main → section → div → p → span
                <main>
                    <section>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                <span>

                                </span>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                </main>

12. Create an ordered list of the top 5 countries you’d like to visit. Within each country, create another ordered list of the top cities you’d like to visit in that country. Maintain proper indentation and make sure you nest your ordered lists properly.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Greece

13. Use pre tags to create a simple [concrete poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_poetry) version of a Haiku or other poem you write. The poem should represent how you feel at this moment.
            <pre>
                my stomache feels weird


                            is it first class    n e r  v o u   s n e  s  s?

                            

                        or am i


                                                h u n g r y
                            
            </pre>
1. Hint: pre tags respect whitespace, you can add add lots of spaces and line breaks and they will show up like that when you view the web page.
    </pre>
14. Write an HTML comment that is hidden from the browser, but displays in the code.
            <!-- secret message -->
15. Create an unordered list of at least 6 musical artists you like to listen to. Add a class to each list item that matches the genre of music of that artist.
    <ul>
        <li class="rock-am">Arctic Monkeys</li>
        <li class="alt">The Last Shadow Puppets</li>
        <li class="alt-girl">Alexandra Saviour</li>
        <li class="surf-rock">Beach Boys</li>
        <li class="rock">The Beatles</li>
        <li class="pop-rap">Doja Cat</li>
    </ul>
<pre>
16. Describe the difference between block, inline-block and inline elements.
    - Inline elements aren't affected by height or width properties. Some inline elements are img, a.
    - Inline-block is very similar to inline, except you can change the height and width properties.
    - Block elements are its own line and takes up the whole width. Some block elements are h1, div.

17. Use CSS to style the musical genre classes you added in question 9. Give each genre a color and personality using CSS.
            
18. Use any CSS knowledge you currently have to style your questionnaire in a unique way. Make sure to update the font to something other than the default (use the font-family css property).

19. In a script tag, use the console.log function to write a message to the console (Cmd+Opt+U). Tell me something interesting about yourself.
20. Add a button to your HTML file and make it do something when clicked using JavaScript.
        To be honest, this is where I definitely need a refresher. I'm not confident at all with JS and tried to look up how to link a sheet but am confused as it's different from what I remember from class. What I have so far is two folders in my folder for this project titled 'library' and 'js'. The js one has a jquery.js file and the other a jquery-3.6.1. file but I don't know what they do or how to link it.
